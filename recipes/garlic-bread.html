    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Garlic bread (also called garlic toast) consists of bread (usually a
      baguette, sour dough, or bread such as ciabatta), topped with garlic and
      occasionally olive oil or butter and may include additional herbs, such as
      oregano or chives. It is then either grilled until toasted or baked in a
